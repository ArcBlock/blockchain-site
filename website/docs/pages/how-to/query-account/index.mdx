## Query account by address

Since each account is identified by account address(DID), we can query account state by address with `getAccountState` method:

```javascript
const Client = require("@ocap/client");

const client = new Client("https://beta.abtnetwork.io/api/");
const { state } = await client.getAccountState({
  address: "zNKZ4YXc9tYZN87KP51b7psz857GBzWFMz3N",
});
console.log(state);
```

## Query account tokens

Each account can have multiple [tokens](/conceptual/tokens), we can query tokens owned by account address with `getAccountTokens` method:

```javascript
const Client = require("@ocap/client");

const client = new Client("https://beta.abtnetwork.io/api/");
const { tokens } = await client.getAccountTokens({
  address: "zNKZ4YXc9tYZN87KP51b7psz857GBzWFMz3N",
});
console.log(tokens);
```

## Query account NFTs

Each account can own multiple [NFTs](/conceptual/nfts), we can query NFTs owned by account address with `listAssets` method:

```javascript
const Client = require("@ocap/client");

const client = new Client("https://beta.abtnetwork.io/api/");
const { assets } = await client.listAssets({
  ownerAddress: "zNKZ4YXc9tYZN87KP51b7psz857GBzWFMz3N",
});
console.log(assets);
```

## Query accounts by token balance

We can also query accounts by token balance to monitor top token holders with `listTopAccounts` method:

```javascript
const Client = require("@ocap/client");

const client = new Client("https://beta.abtnetwork.io/api/");
const { accounts } = await client.listTopAccounts({
  tokenAddress: "z35n6UoHSi9MED4uaQy6ozFgKPaZj2UKrurBG",
});
console.log(accounts);
```
