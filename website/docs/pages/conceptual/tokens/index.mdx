## What is token?

A typical blockchain supports at least 1 cryptocurrency natively, cryptocurrencies on the ArcBlock chain are called **tokens**, a token is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.

- The native token on [main chain](https://main.abtnetwork.io) is [ABT](https://main.abtnetwork.io/explorer/tokens/z35nNRvYxBoHitx9yZ5ATS88psfShzPPBLxYD/txs)
- The native token on [beta chain](https://beta.abtnetwork.io) is [TBA](https://beta.abtnetwork.io/explorer/tokens/z35n6UoHSi9MED4uaQy6ozFgKPaZj2UKrurBG/txs)

Developers can create as many tokens as needed on the ArcBlock chain by sending `CreateTokenTx`.

Users can do more with tokens on ArcBlock chain than other blockchains without any smart contract, such as:

- Transfer tokens to his/her friend
- Pay with tokens to purchase digital properties in NFT format
- Exchange between tokens at some fixed rate

## What is foreign token?

Foreign token is used to correlate a token on ArcBlock chain with a token on EVM compatible chain. The token on both chains has the same symbol, decimal, and supply.

For example: ABT on Arcblock [main chain](https://main.abtnetwork.io/explorer/tokens/z35nNRvYxBoHitx9yZ5ATS88psfShzPPBLxYD/txs) and Ethereum [mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb98d4c97425d9908e66e53a6fdf673acca0be986) are the same

The `foreignToken` field is defined when sending `CreateTokenTx` and can not be updated after creation:

```typescript
type ForeignToken = {
  type: string;
  contractAddress: string;
  chainType: string;
  chainName: string;
  chainId: number;
};
```

A token with a valid foreign token should set up an ArcBridge to allow users to move their tokens between ArcBlock and Ethereum chain.
