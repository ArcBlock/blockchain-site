A transaction must be encoded and signed by the sender's [wallet](../wallets), once sent to the chain, it's decoded and verified, and then executed and appended to the ledger.

- A transaction is identified by `hash` similar to other chains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- A transaction is encoded as binary before being signed and sent to the chain.
- A transaction is decoded and formatted before being displayed on the chain explorer.

## Transaction Structure

To make transactions flexible and extensible, we use a mail-like structure to define a transaction:

- `envelope` = `outer transaction`: contains required fields for all transactions, such as `sender`, `signature`
- `letter` = `inner transaction`: the actual transaction content, such as `DeclareTx`, `DelegateTx`

You can inspect the "Raw Transaction" on [transaction detail](https://beta.abtnetwork.io/explorer/txs/75A57414CE65375A1C4A4BA52F5D1305CD02567F8949718946394AF525DF78CA) from the explorer to get a better understanding of the structure.

### Outer Transaction

The outer transaction structure is defined as follows:

```typescript
type Transaction = {
  from: string; // the transaction sender address
  pk: string; // the transaction sender public key
  nonce: number;
  chainId: string; // must match with the chain
  delegator: string;
  signature: string; // the transaction sender's signature
  signatures: Array<Multisig>; // signatures from other parties, default to empty
  itx: Any;
};
```

### Inner Transaction (itx)

The inner transaction structure varies across different transaction types. Here are some examples:

```typescript
type DeclareTx = {
  moniker: string;
  issuer: string;
  data?: Any;
};

type TransferV2Tx = {
  to: string;
  assets: Array<string>;
  tokens: Array<{
    address: string;
    value: string;
  }>;
  data?: Any;
};
```

:::Alert
The inner transaction is decoded and notated as `itxJson` in chain explorer for better readability.

### Any Type

**Any** type is widely used in transactions to encode data that's attached to the same field but has different types and shapes:

```typescript
type Any = {
  type: string;
  value: any;
};
```

Let's look at how `Any` type is used with an example:

```javascript
const tx = {
  from: "zNKnjMDau9aK6kYkxX7fhFkbozQQhvTzGqnX",
  pk: "0848uy6x11gle2SR3hummTMyZpLRNv_ai4RaquxIDyg",
  chainId: "beta",
  nonce: "1663680171202",
  signature: "Sd4ALBExbm5ssWo4S2RITqJm48BPcb8s1c4UmO-l6o5x5WW619ZEK",
  signatures: [],
  delegator: "",
  itx: {
    type: "DeclareTx",
    value: {
      moniker: "blocklet-registry-service",
      issuer: "",
      data: {
        type: "json",
        value: {
          role: "ROLE_APPLICATION",
          pk: "ED25519",
          hash: "SHA3",
          address: "BASE58",
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

**Any** is used in 2 places in above transaction:

- `itx` field on the outer transaction to attach the inner transaction, which can be any of the [supported types](#transaction-types).
- `data` filed on the inner transaction to attach optional data that can be any type, such as `json` and `vc`.

As you can see from the example **Any** types can be nested.

### Transaction Types

The transaction filter from chain explorer lists all supported transaction types supported. Each transaction type defines a structure that can be used in `itx`.

- Account
  - DeclareTx
  - AccountMigrateTx
  - DelegateTx
  - RevokeDelegateTx
- NFT
  - CreateAssetTx
  - UpdateAssetTx
  - MintAssetTx
  - AcquireAssetV2Tx
  - AcquireAssetV3Tx
  - CreateFactoryTx
- Token
  - CreateTokenTx
  - DepositTokenV2Tx
  - WithdrawTokenV2Tx
- Trading
  - ExchangeV2Tx: with multiple input support
  - TransferV2Tx: with multiple input support
  - TransferV3Tx: with multiple input and output support
- Staking
  - StakeTx
  - RevokeStakeTx
  - ClaimStakeTx
- Rollup
  - CreateRollupTx
  - UpdateRollupTx
  - JoinRollupTx
  - PauseRollupTx
  - ResumeRollupTx
  - MigrateRollupContractTx
  - MigrateRollupTokenTx
  - JoinRollupTx
  - LeaveRollupTx
  - CreateRollupBlockTx
  - ClaimBlockRewardTx

### Transaction Data

Each transaction can have a `data` field that is `Any` type, see next section.

## Transaction Size Limit

To protect the chain from abuse, there are hard limits for each transaction size, transactions that exceed the size limit will fail at the verification phase.

The current size limit (measured by byteLength of the encoded transaction buffer) for each transaction type is:

- AccountMigrate: 348
- CreateAsset: 65881
- CreateFactory: 65881
- Declare: 664
- ExchangeV2: 1691
- Transfer: 664
- TransferV2: 664
- TransferV3: 4096
- UpdateAsset: 65881
- AcquireAssetV2: 4096
- AcquireAssetV3: 4096
- MintAsset: 4096
- CreateToken: 664
- DepositTokenV2: 1691
- WithdrawTokenV2: 1691
- Stake: 4096
- RevokeStake: 664
- ClaimStake: 664
- CreateRollup: 1691
- UpdateRollup: 1691
- PauseRollup: 1691
- ResumeRollup: 1691
- JoinRollup: 1691
- LeaveRollup: 1691
- MigrateRollupContract: 1691
- MigrateRollupToken: 1691
- CreateRollupBlock: 4096
- ClaimBlockReward: 1691

## Transaction Fees

The **Transaction Fee** is another mechanism for protecting the chain from attacks. There are 3 types of fees charged when a transaction is successfully executed:

- Service fee: charged when moving tokens with DepositTokenV2Tx and WithdrawTokenV2Tx across ArcBridge, fee rate may vary between bridges.
- Protocol fee: charged when sending `CreateAssetTx`, `CreateFactoryTx`, `CreateTokenTx` and `CreateRollupTx`.
- Gas fee: charged when sending all transaction types, neither the main nor beta chain enabled gas fee.

## Transaction Signature

### Sender signature

Each transaction carries a signature generated using the sender's secret key. The chain and recipient can verify the sender's signature using the sender's public key, which is published on the chain. This helps ensure that the transaction content received is exactly as it was when the sender initiated the transaction.

### Multi-party signature

In most chain implementations, only the transaction sender is required to sign the transaction. With the sender's signature, we would trust that the operation is authorized by the sender. Transactions like `Transfer` is a typical example that the sender would send some tokens / NFTs to the receiver (without the receiver's permission). In the real-world, vast use cases require authorization among all parties in the transaction.

ArcBlock chain has native support for multi-party-signed transactions. Transactions that support multi-party-signature includes:

- TransferV3Tx: if the transaction input is from multiple payers
- AcquireAssetV3Tx: if the transaction input is from multiple payers
- Rollup Related Tx: signatures are required from all rollup validators
