A transaction must be encoded and signed by the sender's [wallet](../wallets), once sent to the blockchain node, it's decoded and verified, and then executed and appended to the ledger.

## Transaction

```typescript
type Transaction = {
  from: DID;
  nonce: number;
  chainId: string;
  pk: string;
  gas: number;
  delegator: string;
  signature: string;
  signatures: Array<Multisig>;
  itx: google_protobuf_any_pb.Any;
  receipts: Array<TTransactionReceipt>;
  serviceFee: string;
};
```

## Transaction Signatures

### Sender signature

Each transaction carries a signature generated using the sender's secret key. The recipient can verify the sender's signature using the sender's public key, which is published on the blockchain. This helps ensure that the transaction content received is exactly as it was when the sender initiated the transaction.

### Multi signatures
