## What is DID?

DID is a unique identity address calculated from a set of credentials, and we extend DID as unique identifiers for everything in ArcBlock Ecosystem, such as:

- [Account](../wallets)
- [Token](../tokens)
- [NFT](../nfts)
- [NFT Factory](../nfts)
- Stake
- Delegation
- [Blocklet](https://developer.blocklet.io/docs/en/reference/blocklet-spec#DID)
- Server

## How to Create DID?

:::Alert{type=success}
Please note that sometimes the terms DID and address are used interchangeably in this documentation.

### DID Notation

A typical DID provided by ArcBlock looks like this:

```
did:abt:z1muQ3xqHQK2uiACHyChikobsiY5kLqtShA
  DID            DID String
schema
```

### DID Type

Bitcoin and Ethereum use secp256k1 for the public key encryption of their wallets, to generate the wallet address, they used fixed hash algorithms.
In arcblock, we make it flexible and extensible - developer or user can choose their favorite algorithms combination. For example, by default, we uses ED25519 for public key encryption, Sha3 for public key hash, and base58 (actually, base58 with multibase prefix) for address.
DID type is the first two bytes of the DID string's binary format. It contains three sections:

1. The first six bits are the `RoleType` of DID, e.g., `account` = 0
2. The following 5 bits denote the `KeyType`, algorithm to convert secret key to public key, e.g., `ED25519` = 0
3. The latter 5 bits represent the `HashType` function to calculate the hash of the public key, e.g., `sha3` = 1

So DID type bytes `0x0C01` can be interpreted as follows:

```
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| 000011      | 00000     | 00001      |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
| application | ed25519   | sha3       |
+-------------+-----------+------------+
```

See [Appendix](#Appendix) for the full list of `RoleType`, `KeyType` and `HashType`.

### DID Algorithm

It's calculated with following algorithm:

- Step 1: Choose the _RoleType_, _KeyType_ and _Hash_ from above, let's use `application`, `ed25519` and `sha3` in this example.
- Step 2: Choose a secret key randomly, e.g.
  ```
  D67C071B6F51D2B61180B9B1AA9BE0DD0704619F0E30453AB4A592B036EDE644E4852B7091317E3622068E62A5127D1FB0D4AE2FC50213295E10652D2F0ABFC7
  ```
- Step 3: Generate the public key of this secret key by using the _KeyType_. So we can get public key
  ```
  E4852B7091317E3622068E62A5127D1FB0D4AE2FC50213295E10652D2F0ABFC7
  ```
- Step 4: Get the _Hash_ of the public key
  ```
  EC8E681514753FE5955D3E8B57DAEC9D123E3DB146BDDFC3787163F77F057C27
  ```
- Step 5: Take the first 20 bytes of the public key hash
  ```
  EC8E681514753FE5955D3E8B57DAEC9D123E3DB1
  ```
- Step 6: Add the DID type bytes `0x0C01` in front of the hash of Step 4
  ```
  0C01EC8E681514753FE5955D3E8B57DAEC9D123E3DB1
  ```
- Step 7: Get the hash of the extended hash in Step 6
  ```
  42CD815145538F8003586C880AF94418341F9C4B8FA0394876553F8A952C7D03
  ```
- Step 8: Take the first 4 bytes in step 7
  ```
  42CD8151
  ```
- Step 9: Append the 4 bytes in step 8 to the extended hash in step 6. This is the binary DID string
  ```
  0C01EC8E681514753FE5955D3E8B57DAEC9D123E3DB142CD8151
  ```
- Step 10: Encode the binary value by using the Bitcoin Base58 method. Note, we are using IPFS's [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase) to encode as `base58_btc` type, it will add a `z` in the beginning of the base58 encoded string
  ```
  zNKtCNqYWLYWYW3gWRA1vnRykfCBZYHZvzKr
  ```
- Step 11: Assemble the parts and get the full DID
  ```
  did:abt:zNKtCNqYWLYWYW3gWRA1vnRykfCBZYHZvzKr
  ```
